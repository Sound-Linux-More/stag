NAME
     stag - curses based audio file tagger

SYNOPSIS
     stag [directory ...]

DESCRIPTION
     stag is a curses based audio tagger that supports MP3, OGG, and FLAC
     audio files. The user interface of stag is split into four seperate
     panels, corresponding to four unique modes, each with their own set of
     commands: directory-mode, file-mode, info-mode, and edit-mode.  There are
     a few other terms this man page uses that should be defined in order to
     avoid ambiguity: active-buffer, a list of files that can be edited with
     tag editing commands; mark, the currently highlighted element; selected
     files, a list of files that are a subset of the active-buffer that some
     commands uniquely address. While most keybindings are local to the
     current mode, a few keybindings are available with nearly identical
     semantics in directory-mode, file-mode, and info-mode:

     n		Move the mark down one entry.

     C-n | PGDN
		Move the mark down by one page of entries. In info-mode, this
		does nothing.

     p | UP	Move the mark up one entry.

     C-p | PGUP
		Move the mark up by one page of entries. In info-mode, this
		does nothing.

     q		Exit stag.

DIRECTORY-MODE
     Associated with the left-most panel of the curses interface of stag,
     directory-mode displays a list of directories in the current directory.
     One then navigates across the filesystem, adding the desired directories
     to the active-buffer.

     The following is the list of keybindings available in directory-mode and
     their corresponding actions:

     RET	Enter the directory under the mark.  This then displays the
		children directories of the directory under the mark in the
		directory panel.

     SPC	Recursively add the directories and files to the active-buffer
		that are children to the directory under the mark.

     h		Toggle whether hidden directories are displayed in the
		directory panel.

     o | RIGHT	Switch focus to the file panel, thus entering file-mode.

FILE-MODE
     Associated with the right-most panel of the curses interface of stag,
     file-mode displays the contents of the active-buffer: a list of audio
     files who's tags can be edited with a variety of commands.

     The following is a list of keybindings and their associated action that
     are available in file-mode:

     RET	Edit the file under the mark, thus switching to info-mode.

     SPC	Toggles the selection status of the file under the mark.
		Therefore transforming a selected file into a unselected file
		and vice versa.

     /		Prompts the user for an ERE (see re_format(7)) and toggles the
		selection status of all files that have tags that match the
		ERE. The tags are compiled into one string of the form
		``track: %d title: %s artist: %s album: %s genre: %s year: %d
		comment: %s'' for matching purposes.

     a		Toggle the selection status of all files in the active-buffer.
		Consequently, when no files are selected and this key is
		pressed, all of the files in the active-buffer will be
		selected. Pressed again, all of the files will be deselected.

     c		Clear the active-buffer.

     d		Remove the currently selected files.

     e		Edit the currently selected files, thus switching to
		info-mode.

     o | LEFT	switch focus to the directory panel, thus entering
		directory-mode.

     r		Reload the currently selected files from disk, undoing all
		previous edit operations.

     s		Write the file under the mark to the disk.

     u		Convert all selected files in the active-buffer into normal
		files.

     w		Write all selected files in the active-buffer to the disk.

INFO-MODE
     info-mode is associated with the panel immediately below both the
     directory panel and the file panel. Normally this panel just displays the
     tag information of the file under the mark.  When in info-mode one can
     choose a tag to edit.

     The following is a list of keybindings and their respective actions
     available in info-mode:

     LEFT	Switch focus to the directory panel, thus entering
		directory-mode.

     RET	Edit the tag under the mark.  This consequently switches the
		focus to the edit panel and enters edit-mode.

     o		Switch the focus  to the file panel, entering file-mode.

EDIT-MODE
     edit-mode is associated with the last line of the display. In this mode
     is where the actual editing of the tag is done. Emacs-style cursor
     movement bindings are used to help facilitate quick editing of tags in
     this mode.

     The following is a list of keybindings and their corresponding actions
     available in edit-mode:

     BACKSPC	Delete character before cursor.

     RET	Switch to info-mode.

     C-a	Jump to the beginning of the line.

     C-b | LEFT
		Move back one character.

     M-b	Jump back one word.

     C-d	Delete character under cursor.

     C-e	Jump to the end of the line.

     C-f | RIGHT
		Move forward one character.

     M-f	Jump forward one word.

     C-k	Delete from the cursor to the end of the line.
