DDEESSCCRRIIPPTTIIOONN
     ssttaagg is a curses based audio tagger that supports MP3, OGG, and FLAC
     audio files. The user interface of ssttaagg is split into four seperate
     panels, corresponding to four unique modes, each with their own set of
     commands: _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y_-_m_o_d_e, _f_i_l_e_-_m_o_d_e, _i_n_f_o_-_m_o_d_e, and _e_d_i_t_-_m_o_d_e.  There are
     a few other terms this man page uses that should be defined in order to
     avoid ambiguity: _a_c_t_i_v_e_-_b_u_f_f_e_r, a list of files that can be edited with
     tag editing commands; _m_a_r_k, the currently highlighted element; _s_e_l_e_c_t_e_d
     files, a list of files that are a subset of the _a_c_t_i_v_e_-_b_u_f_f_e_r that some
     commands uniquely address. While most keybindings are local to the
     current mode, a few keybindings are available with nearly identical
     semantics in _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y_-_m_o_d_e, _f_i_l_e_-_m_o_d_e, and _i_n_f_o_-_m_o_d_e:

     n          Move the _m_a_r_k down one entry.

     C-n | PGDN
                Move the _m_a_r_k down by one page of entries. In _i_n_f_o_-_m_o_d_e, this
                does nothing.

     p | UP     Move the _m_a_r_k up one entry.

     C-p | PGUP
                Move the _m_a_r_k up by one page of entries. In _i_n_f_o_-_m_o_d_e, this
                does nothing.

     q          Exit ssttaagg.

DDIIRREECCTTOORRYY--MMOODDEE
     Associated with the left-most panel of the curses interface of ssttaagg,
     _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y_-_m_o_d_e displays a list of directories in the current directory.
     One then navigates across the filesystem, adding the desired directories
     to the _a_c_t_i_v_e_-_b_u_f_f_e_r.

     The following is the list of keybindings available in _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y_-_m_o_d_e and
     their corresponding actions:

     RET        Enter the directory under the _m_a_r_k.  This then displays the
                children directories of the directory under the _m_a_r_k in the
                directory panel.

     SPC        Recursively add the directories and files to the _a_c_t_i_v_e_-_b_u_f_f_e_r
                that are children to the directory under the _m_a_r_k.

     h          Toggle whether hidden directories are displayed in the
                directory panel.

     o | RIGHT  Switch focus to the file panel, thus entering _f_i_l_e_-_m_o_d_e.

FFIILLEE--MMOODDEE
     Associated with the right-most panel of the curses interface of ssttaagg,
     _f_i_l_e_-_m_o_d_e displays the contents of the _a_c_t_i_v_e_-_b_u_f_f_e_r: a list of audio
     files who's tags can be edited with a variety of commands.

     The following is a list of keybindings and their associated action that
     are available in _f_i_l_e_-_m_o_d_e:

     RET        Edit the file under the _m_a_r_k, thus switching to _i_n_f_o_-_m_o_d_e.

     SPC        Toggles the selection status of the file under the _m_a_r_k.
                Therefore transforming a _s_e_l_e_c_t_e_d file into a unselected file
                and vice versa.

     /          Prompts the user for an ERE (see re_format(7)) and toggles the
                selection status of all files that have tags that match the
                ERE. The tags are compiled into one string of the form
                ``track: %d title: %s artist: %s album: %s genre: %s year: %d
                comment: %s'' for matching purposes.

     a          Toggle the selection status of all files in the _a_c_t_i_v_e_-_b_u_f_f_e_r.
                Consequently, when no files are selected and this key is
                pressed, all of the files in the _a_c_t_i_v_e_-_b_u_f_f_e_r will be
                selected. Pressed again, all of the files will be deselected.

     c          Clear the _a_c_t_i_v_e_-_b_u_f_f_e_r.

     d          Remove the currently _s_e_l_e_c_t_e_d files.

     e          Edit the currently _s_e_l_e_c_t_e_d files, thus switching to
                _i_n_f_o_-_m_o_d_e.

     o | LEFT   switch focus to the directory panel, thus entering
                _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y_-_m_o_d_e.

     r          Reload the currently _s_e_l_e_c_t_e_d files from disk, undoing all
                previous edit operations.

     s          Write the file under the _m_a_r_k to the disk.

     u          Convert all _s_e_l_e_c_t_e_d files in the _a_c_t_i_v_e_-_b_u_f_f_e_r into normal
                files.

     w          Write all _s_e_l_e_c_t_e_d files in the _a_c_t_i_v_e_-_b_u_f_f_e_r to the disk.

IINNFFOO--MMOODDEE
     _i_n_f_o_-_m_o_d_e is associated with the panel immediately below both the
     directory panel and the file panel. Normally this panel just displays the
     tag information of the file under the _m_a_r_k.  When in _i_n_f_o_-_m_o_d_e one can
     choose a tag to edit.

     The following is a list of keybindings and their respective actions
     available in _i_n_f_o_-_m_o_d_e:

     LEFT       Switch focus to the directory panel, thus entering
                _d_i_r_e_c_t_o_r_y_-_m_o_d_e.

     RET        Edit the tag under the _m_a_r_k.  This consequently switches the
                focus to the edit panel and enters _e_d_i_t_-_m_o_d_e.

     o          Switch the focus  to the file panel, entering _f_i_l_e_-_m_o_d_e.

EEDDIITT--MMOODDEE
     _e_d_i_t_-_m_o_d_e is associated with the last line of the display. In this mode
     is where the actual editing of the tag is done. Emacs-style cursor
     movement bindings are used to help facilitate quick editing of tags in
     this mode.

     The following is a list of keybindings and their corresponding actions
     available in _e_d_i_t_-_m_o_d_e:

     BACKSPC    Delete character before cursor.

     RET        Switch to _i_n_f_o_-_m_o_d_e.

     C-a        Jump to the beginning of the line.

     C-b | LEFT
                Move back one character.

     M-b        Jump back one word.

     C-d        Delete character under cursor.

     C-e        Jump to the end of the line.

     C-f | RIGHT
                Move forward one character.

     M-f        Jump forward one word.

     C-k        Delete from the cursor to the end of the line.
