Compile and install with:

$ make

if you want to compile stag with ncurses wide character support:
 
$ make CURSES=-lncursesw

otherwise:

$ make

$ cp stag /path/to/bin/
$ cp stag.1 /path/to/man/

If you're using a braindead man formatter like groff, the man page
might be fucked up. stag.0 is included for this reason.
